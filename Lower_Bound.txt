Lower Bound
Given an array of integers A (sorted) and a integer Val.

Implement a function that takes A and Val as input parameters and returns the lower bound of Val.

Note : If Val is not present in array then Lower bound of a given integer means integer which is just smaller than given integer.

Otherwise Val itself is the answer.

If Val is less than smallest element of array A then return '-1' in that case.

Example 1  :

A = [-1, -1, 2, 3, 5]

Val = 4

Answer :  3

Since 3 is just smaller than 4 in the array.

Example 2  :

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]

Val = 4

Answer :  4
Since 4 is equal to 4.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


int lowerBound(vector<int> A, int val) {
    // your code goes here
    int s = 0;
    int e = A.size()-1;
    int ans = -1;
    
    while(s<=e){
        int mid = (s+e)/2;
        if(A[mid] <= val){
            ans = A[mid];
            s = mid+1;
            
        }else{
            e = mid-1;
        }
    }
   return ans;
}
